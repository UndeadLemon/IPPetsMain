#### Welcome to IP Pets!

IP pets is a small web based toy that gives every IP address it's own pet!

Just like every house can have a pet, every IP has a pet that needs to be fed on a certain timer. If you wait too long to feed your pet, next time you log in to check on it you'll find that a new pet has moved in!

This project utilizes Python/Flask for the basic functionality, SQL to store and retrieve pet information, Javascript (via the Bootstrap framework) for page styling and certain button functionality, and a Zoo Animals API to fetch images for each pet.

Soon, there will also be more unique pet stats, more information about the type of animal your pet is, pet moods, and more!
